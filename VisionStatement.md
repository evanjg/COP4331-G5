## Vision Statement
 
For students and those in need of organization/motivation to walk around and visit locations on campus, the [Insert Name Here] is a mobile ARG that incentivizes visiting various locations and physical movement by connecting an avatarâ€™s well-being.
Unlike similar applications such as PokemonGo, which also incentivizes players to visit various physical locations, [Insert Name Here] provides various animal avatars that each have different benefits and playstyles, creating a more personalized play experience.
